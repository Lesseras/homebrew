Satyrs are very much at home in inns and taverns, sometimes venturing into humanoid settlements (usually in disguise) purely to sample the atmosphere of a particularly famous common room, gaze upon an extremely beautiful person, or taste an especially rich food."

Others are more solitary, retreating to some secluded hermitage to perfect a piece of music or recover after a particularly intense festival."

The grooming habits of satyrs are unpredictable, as fey fashions can change rapidly, but the vast majority put at least some effort into looking good at all times.",

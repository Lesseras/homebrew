Though rare, they are numerous enough and share enough similarities with each other that they may be counted as an actual race of people, and not just freak mishaps of magic. While it may be that there are dedicated creators of geppettin, as there are with golems, a significant number of them have come to life on their own.",
							"Physically, geppettin are quite small, often slightly shorter than halflings. Their physical features vary greatly from type to type, but they are almost always humanoid in shape. For simplicity, geppettin are classified by the materials of which they are composed: bisque are porcelain, marionettes are wood, and raggedy are made of fabric.",
							"Despite being made of somewhat flimsy materials, sentience seems to grant them an odd hardiness. Additionally, due to their non-living nature, they never hunger, rarely tire, and are adept at being innocuous. Most find some form of work or profession in entertainment, but a few find fantastic success as spies and assassins."

A person's first reactions to a geppettin can be most telling, and usually fall into two camps: those that find the geppettin delightful, perhaps recalling cherished childhood memories; and those that are taken by an unnerving phobia, feeling a sudden chill upon seeing a doll move of its own impetus."

						"The core principle of this crafting system is simplicity and specificity. Everything works with simple, easy to follow rules, but has enough depth to lift the burden from a GM having to fill in every blank by giving specific details for everything. While a GM is always the arbiter of what exists and if a crafting recipe works, by and large this system can be run with as much or as little input as a GM wants to add. It's a complete package that provides all the necessarily details for your players to get started\u2014and plenty of tables and guides for GMs as well.",

But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you need without finding it in a dragon hoard, what you find in that dragon hoard can be so much more.",
								"In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk, there are just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A {@item +1 shortsword|DMG} that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafter's creativity.",

								"Crafting is mostly about the time, effort, knowledge and materials. As such, most of crafting is knowing the recipe and having the time and materials needed... but a skilled craftsman works quicker and is more successful, and in this business practice makes perfect, so there are various progression modifiers that apply. Your GM can determine if your background would merit starting your adventure with any, otherwise guidelines for how to gain them are included."

								"The basis of how crafting works is similar between each field, but the recipes, material, and most important results will be radically different... After all, a healing potion, a catapult, and a magic sword are all things you can craft, but the process for each varies quite a bit.",

								"How much of the detail you want to engage with as a GM can be easily adjusted by how you hand out reagents. By sticking to the standard ingredients and using their generic names, the materials are no more complicated than handing out gold or other rewards (and can even be fully converted easily to a gold-based system if you want the most simplified version), but if you'd like to have specific ingredient names and exotic ingredients there is {@book information in the appendix|GGGG|24} you can draw from for that."
